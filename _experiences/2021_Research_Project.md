  - The unpredictability of message delays in the synchronization process greatly influence the performance of time synchronization in wireless sensor networks.
  - We propose a joint design of delay compensation and one-way synchronization, which achieves estimation of clock parameters and fluctuated message delays at the same time.
  - We design a one-way broadcast scheme which update clock parameters with only one-way message based on the Kalman filter.
  - With the accurate delay estimation, we derive an improved clock offset estimation algorithm.
  - The proposed algorithm is performed on MATLAB simulation and experimental testbed with five nRF52832 Bluetooth nodes.
