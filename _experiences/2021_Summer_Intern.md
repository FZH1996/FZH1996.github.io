  - The current system embeddes verify process within the program, which makes a large number of repeated work and is to difficult to upgrade uniformly. 
  - We integrated various protocol interface outside and form an unified authentication platform.
  - This platform provides disaster recovery processing capabilities and expansion to various authentication methods, such as gragh captcha, QQ login, SMS service, facial recognition and paycard verification.
  - Though program, I have have a deeper understanding of C++ and Linux programming, internet communication and networking.
